These are all dangerous illegal drugs which you know you should not use. Most drugs are </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10b4 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">addictive and will cause you harm. So it is best to avoid taking them and always say “No!” to a drug </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10b5 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dealer or pusher who offers you a free sample.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y10b6 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps you know someone who has already got the habit. At a party, one of your friends may </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10b7 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suggest you give it a try. Peer pressure often makes you feel that you are not part of the group </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10b8 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unless you join in. Often young people think “It won’t affect me” or “I’ll just give it a try”. But once </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10b9 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you have started, you may never be able to kick the habit, and your need for another ‘fix’ grows </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10ba ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stronger as time passes. You have become a drug addict.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y10bb ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">All drugs are dangerous, but heroin is the most addictive. Once you have started injecting heroin </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10bc ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into your veins, the craving for another fix will very quickly take hold of you. You will do anything </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10bd ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to get enough money to pay the dealer for your next small packet of white powder. You will beg, </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10be ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">borrow or even steal from your parents and friends to get the money. And you can never be sure </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10bf ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the powder you are being sold as pure heroin does not also contain other additives such as </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10c0 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talcum powder or chalk. When heroin addicts try to break the habit, the withdrawal symptoms </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10c1 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when you come off the drug cause you to suffer cold sweats, hot chills, stomach cramps and </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y10c2 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jangling nerves. You are hooked and cannot escape the dreadful embrace of the drug.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y10c3 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Another danger of drug taking is sharing needles to inject the drug.
