There was </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b15 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no trace of their ship, which moments before had turned turtle and slipped under the waves. The </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b16 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sailors clung to the hull of their frail craft in desperation as the waves hissed and tossed them </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b17 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">aloft or they plunged into the deep troughs between the raging billows. They did not know how </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b18 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long the storm lasted, but gradually the wind fell and the waves grew quieter. Thankfully the </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b19 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men clambered aboard their frail craft, grateful for the warmth of the sun that dried their sodden </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b1a ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clothes. Wearily they stretched themselves out in the bottom of the boat and gradually fell asleep.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1b1b ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When they woke, the full horror of their situation sank in. The weary sailors elected the </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b1c ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strongest man as captain, who arranged for the men to take it in turns to keep watch and look out </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b1d ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for any passing ship. Then he assessed their situation. They were miles from land, in the middle </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b1e ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the ocean with no food and little water – only a small bottle that had been jammed under the </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b1f ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thwarts of the boat. Suddenly one man pointed across the surface of the sea at a small triangle </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b20 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which jutted above the surface of the ocean. “Shark!” he cried as the other craned their necks to </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b21 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">follow his pointing finger.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1b22 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A gentle bump against the side of the boat gave them even more cause for worry. They had </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b23 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard many tales of sharks and how even one drop of blood scented by these jackals of the sea </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b24 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could be the cause of all their deaths. Now they saw a number of sharks clustered around the boat </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b25 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as if waiting for their moment when they could gorge themselves on the bodies of the shipwrecked </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b26 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sailors.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1b27 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Grab that spar,” shouted the captain elect. “If we keep splashing the water we will drive the </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b28 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cowardly creatures off.” A rota was quickly arranged; one man kept a lookout for passing ships, the </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b29 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other kept splashing the surface to deter the sharks. Then the sailors faced the problem of food </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b2a ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and drink. They did not know how long they would be afloat while waiting for rescue. One man </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b2b ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devised a small fishing rod with a bent pin as a hook, which he trailed overboard, eventually with </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b2c ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some small success. They shared his prize fish between them, tearing the raw flesh and devouring </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b2d ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it in quick gulps, but the problem of thirst was becoming acute. The captain measured out a small </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b2e ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">amount of water from the bottle. It tasted foul and brackish, but he would only let each man have </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b2f ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a single sip, as he knew their lives depended on using the water sparingly. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1b30 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the day wore on the sun grew hotter overhead. The men tried to escape its rays by making </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b31 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a small patch of shade from a piece of canvas they found tucked under the thwarts. At first they </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b32 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughed and joked when they had completed this task, but as they day wore on and the heat </div><div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1b33 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">increased, they fell silent, each man nursing his own sombre thoughts.
