A year ago a friend of hers, </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y248b ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by the name of Fati, had been forced by her parents to marry a young man she didn’t like. This </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y248c ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young man, Fosu, was a great hunter who gave Fati’s parents a lot of the meat they needed. In fact </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y248d ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fosu had given them so much meat that they felt obliged to reward him with their daughter as a </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y248e ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife. Fati for one reason or the other didn’t like Fosu. He was not the type of man she wanted for a </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y248f ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">husband.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y2490 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He had asked Fati for a kola nut and she had bluntly told him she would not give him one. He </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2491 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected Fati to step aside when she met him on the wayside as a sign of love and respect for a </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2492 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">future husband, but she would not. Instead of being shy, and hiding when Fosu brought firewood </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2493 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and meat to her mother’s house at night, she would sit on a chair by her brother and try to </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2494 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">converse as if there were no important stranger in the house.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y2495 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">All through the ceremonies, Fati had always been forced by her parents to accept the hunter. </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2496 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She had been forced to dip her hand and bangle into the wooden cask of oil during the bangle </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2497 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceremony. All along, Fati’s parents encouraged Fosu to visit them weekly, but the more he came, </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2498 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the more Fati grew to dislike him.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y2499 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fati’s mother took note of what was happening, but privately told Fosu not to worry. She said </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y249a ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fati would have to marry him as ordained by the tradition of the tribe.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y249b ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the day when the marriage was to take place came. That night, as usual, Fosu brought </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y249c ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his bundle of firewood and meat after the evening meal had been eaten and all was set for the </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y249d ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceremony. Fati’s mother asked her to come over, but she retorted, ‘Na, you know that this man is </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y249e ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not my husband. How many times do you want me to tell you this?’</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y249f ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">‘My daughter,’ replied her mother, ‘Fosu is young and strong and many girls, except you, would </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y24a0 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like him for a husband.’</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y24a1 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">‘If many girls want him for a husband, they can have him. I shall not be his wife,’ Fati replied.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y24a2 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">‘All this time I have been begging you to accept the man your father and I know is good for you,’ </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y24a3 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her mother continued. ‘You have no choice, dear daughter. Our people say that a child only suffers </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y24a4 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when the mother is not there.
