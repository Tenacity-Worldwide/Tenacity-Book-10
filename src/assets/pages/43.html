He shouted, ‘Wake </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y783 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up! Get up!’ We were not let out of cells until 6.45. Before that we had to clean our cells and roll </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y784 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up our mats and blankets. We had no running water in our cells and instead of toilets had iron </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y785 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buckets.

We were given porridge made from maize. We also </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y788 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">received a cup of what was described as coffee, but which was in fact ground-up maize.

At noon, the bell sounded for lunch. For Africans, </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y790 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lunch was boiled maize. We often received <span class="ff32">phuzamandla</span>, which is a drink made from maize </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y791 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a bit of yeast.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y792 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After lunch we worked until four.

The bathroom at the </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y794 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end of our corridor had two saltwater showers, a saltwater tap, and three large metal buckets, </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y795 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which were used as bathtubs. There was no hot water. We soaped ourselves with the salty water, </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y796 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">washing off the dust from the day. We sometimes sang while washing, which made the water </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y797 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seem less icy. This was one of the only times we could have a conversation.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y798 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At exactly 4.30, there was always a loud knock on the wooden door, which meant that supper </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y799 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been delivered. We again received porridge, sometimes with a carrot or piece of cabbage </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y79a ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thrown in. Every other day, we received a small piece of meat with our porridge.
