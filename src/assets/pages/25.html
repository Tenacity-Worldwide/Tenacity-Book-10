She found it very </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y424 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interesting, as the health worker told the Club about First Aid and what they should do if there was an </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y425 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accident in the home.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y426 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At her first meeting, Ayantu learned what to do if someone had a bad cut. The health worker </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y427 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told the students that they should gently wash the wound with clean or boiled water. They should </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y428 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dry the surrounding area, then carefully cover the wound with a very clean pad of cloth, with a </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y429 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bandage to hold it in place. If the cut was only small, they could apply an antiseptic cream after </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y42a ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">washing and cleaning the wound. But if the wound was very deep, they should take the patient </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y42b ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the clinic. If the patient had not been immunised against tetanus, they should tell the nurse </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y42c ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the clinic. At other meetings of the Health Club Ayantu also learned how to treat shock, bites, </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y42d ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sprains and burns. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y42e ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayantu needed the First Aid that she had learned at the Health Club when </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y42f ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her brother Kassa had an accident at home. Kassa was boiling some water on </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y430 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the fire to make a cup of tea for her. While he was pouring out the water, he </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y431 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accidentally dropped the pot. The boiling water splashed onto his leg and over </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y432 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his foot. Kassa screamed with the pain and shock.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y433 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayantu heard his scream and came running. She saw what had happened </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y434 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and knew she must act quickly to give Kassa First Aid. She remembered that </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y435 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the first thing to do for a burn is to cool the injured part as quickly as you can. </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y436 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A burn is very, very painful and the shock from the pain can make the person </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y437 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ill. By cooling the burned area immediately, she would reduce the damage </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y438 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the pain.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y439 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Kassa, you will be all right. Just sit on this chair,” Ayantu said calmly. Kassa </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y43a ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sat down and Ayantu shouted for their mother to come and help. Then she put </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y43b ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Kassa’s foot in a bowl and poured cold water down his leg. She acted as quickly </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y43c ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as she could and did not stop to take off his shoes and socks.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y43d ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Weizero Fatima came running from the house. “What’s the matter?” she </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y43e ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cried. Ayantu explained what had happened. She knew that when someone </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y43f ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has a burn, the injured part usually swells up. Anything tight around the </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y440 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burned area, like a watch or a shoe, must be taken off before the swelling gets </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y441 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too bad, so she said to her mother, “Can you take off Kassa’s shoe before his </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y442 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">foot swells up too much, while I carry on pouring cold water down his leg?” </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y443 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayantu remembered that it takes a long time to get the heat out of the injured </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y444 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">part of the body, so she went on cooling it with water for at least ten minutes.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y445 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After Weizero Fatima had taken off Kassa’s shoe, she telephoned a doctor. </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y446 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The doctor said, “Make sure you do not touch the burn. Treat Kassa for shock, </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y447 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then bring him to the hospital.” </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y448 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Weizero Fatima went back to the patient. “Kassa,” she said, “the doctor says that Ayantu is giving </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y449 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you the right treatment, but I think that you had better lie down until you feel a little better.” Weizero </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y44a ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fatima knew that this would help the shock.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y44b ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayantu helped her brother lie down with his feet slightly higher than his body. While she was </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y44c ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covering him lightly with a blanket she noticed a blister on Kassa’s leg. “Look at this blister, Mother. </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y44d ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shall we burst it?” she asked.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y44e ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“No!” Weizero Fatima replied. “You must never prick or burst a blister on a burn. If you do, germs </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y44f ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will get into the wound and it will make the injury much worse. Also, never put things like toothpaste, </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y450 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">butter, soap or antiseptic cream on burned skin.”</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y451 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After about an hour Kassa was not feeling so shocked, so Weizero Fatima called a taxi. Before they </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y452 ff23 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">left, she took a clean, dry cloth and wrapped it gently round Kassa’s leg. Then they went to the hospital.</div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y13 ff27 fs8 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">M02_ENG_SB_ETHG10_0261_M02.indd   21<span class="_ _46"> </span>28/3/11   10:34:56 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
