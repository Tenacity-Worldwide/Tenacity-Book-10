Beside her was a jerrycan for water. She was on her </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d yca5 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls4 ws0">way to fill it at the well, but had stopped for a short rest.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d yca6 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Makeda was just 14 and was very beautiful. She wasn’t very good at school because she was </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d yca7 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always daydreaming and never paid attention. She dreamed about the husband </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d yca8 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that she would marry one day. He would be a handsome young </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d yca9 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">businessman. He would have a big house, a beautiful car and many </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycaa ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">servants, and would keep her in comfort for the rest of her life.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycab ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Hello, Makeda. Come here, my dear,” a voice said. Makeda woke </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycac ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from her daydream and saw the businessman standing nearby. </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycad ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The businessman was the richest man in the area. He was about 40 </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycae ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old and he was fat and ugly. Nevertheless, Makeda smiled at </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycaf ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him because the businessman was very kind to her.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycb0 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“It’s a shame to see a beautiful girl like you going to the well to </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb1 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carry a heavy jerrycan of water,” said the businessman. “And look at </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb2 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that old dress you’re wearing. If you had a little money, you could </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb3 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buy some nice clothes. Then a rich young man would notice you </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb4 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and marry you.”</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycb5 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“I know, the businessman,<span class="_ _3"></span>” <span class="_ _3"></span>s<span class="_ _5"></span>a<span class="_ _3"></span>id<span class="_ _3"></span> <span class="_ _3"></span>Ma<span class="_ _3"></span>k<span class="_ _5"></span>e<span class="_ _3"></span>da<span class="_ _3"></span>.<span class="_ _3"></span> “<span class="_ _3"></span>I <span class="_ _3"></span>w<span class="_ _3"></span>as<span class="_ _3"></span> <span class="_ _3"></span>th<span class="_ _3"></span>i<span class="_ _5"></span>n<span class="_ _3"></span>ki<span class="_ _3"></span>n<span class="_ _3"></span>g <span class="_ _3"></span>th<span class="_ _3"></span>e <span class="_ _3"></span>s<span class="_ _3"></span>am<span class="_ _3"></span>e </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb6 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">t<span class="_ _3"></span>hi<span class="_ _3"></span>ng<span class="_ _3"></span> m<span class="_ _3"></span>ys<span class="_ _3"></span>e<span class="_ _5"></span>l<span class="_ _3"></span>f,<span class="_ _3"></span> b<span class="_ _3"></span>ut<span class="_ _3"></span> I<span class="_ _3"></span> <span class="_ _5"></span>c<span class="_ _3"></span>an<span class="_ _3"></span>’t<span class="_ _3"></span> a<span class="_ _3"></span>f<span class="_ _5"></span>f<span class="_ _3"></span>or<span class="_ _3"></span>d <span class="_ _3"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb7 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls12 ws0">these things.”</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycb8 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The businessman came closer to Makeda and whispered softly </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb9 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in her ear, “I could help you with the money, my dear. Come to my </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycba ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shop tonight and we can talk about it.”</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycbb ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Makeda knew that the businessman was suggesting that he should become her sugar daddy. She </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycbc ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not really like him, but he was rich. If he gave her money, she could buy the things she wanted. </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycbd ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then she could go to Addis Ababa where she would meet the young man of her dreams. As Makeda </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycbe ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was filling her jerrycan at the well, she decided to go to the businessman’s shop that night.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycbf ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Makeda went to the businessman’s shop twice a week for about three months. He gave her a </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc0 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little money every time she came. She bought handkerchiefs, perfume and some skin lotion with </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc1 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the money. Then, one evening, when she wanted more money, she went to the shop and the </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc2 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">businessman told her to go away. She heard another girl laughing in the room behind the shop.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycc3 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Makeda felt very angry. She made up her mind that she would never have anything to do with </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc4 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men like the businessman ever again. Then, one month later, she missed her period. She was </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc5 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frightened and surprised. “I can’t be pregnant,” she thought. “The businessman told me that I </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc6 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couldn’t get pregnant with him because he knew all about family planning and contraception.”</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycc7 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Makeda missed another period, she got really worried and decided to discuss her problem </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc8 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with her best friend, Worknesh. “Please advise me, Worknesh. I think I may be pregnant. What </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc9 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should I do? I can’t have the baby. My father is very strict and he’d kill me if he found out. What do </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycca ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you think I should do? Please help me. I am very worried.”</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d yccb ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fortunately, Worknesh’s mother was a social worker with the local council. When she heard </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d yccc ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about Makeda’s problem, she was very angry. She knew that the businessman was guilty of child </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d yccd ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">abuse, and that if Makeda reported him, he would be arrested, taken to court and tried for </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycce ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">defiling the girl. But she also knew that the businessman would plead not guilty, and that without </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d yccf ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">any witnesses, the judge or magistrate would declare him innocent of the crime. Also, Makeda’s </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd0 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father would be so angry that he would force his daughter into an early marriage, with no hope of </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd1 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allowing her to continue her education. In such a marriage, the young girl might be mistreated by </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd2 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an elderly husband, while the real criminal, the businessman, would not be imprisoned, but would </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd3 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enjoy his freedom and escape being sentenced for his crime.</div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y13 ff40 fs8 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">M04_ENG_SB_ETHG10_0261_M04.indd   69<span class="_ _46"> </span>28/3/11   10:38:20 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
